### **The 14 habits of highly effective developers **

#### Introduction

Many believe that transitioning from an effective Junior-level developer to a mid-level is just a matter of time and experience. Truth is that the line separating these 2 kinds of developers is very thin and subject. This article is not going to add more to the endless debate on "What exactly defines a mid-level developer".

To be honest, I firmly believe that something that can shift one's mindset and help in transitioning on from a Junior to a Mid-level or Senior developer is **habits**:

***A habit is something that you start doing systematically until it is no longer something strange to you but comes naturally.***

***Forming code-related and work-related habits is of crucial importance when it comes to professional and personal advancement.***

Let's see a list of everyday habits that, upon mastering them, will definitely help you get to the next level and progress fruitfully:

#### 1.Write small methods

Ideally, no more 20~30 lines of code (LoC)long. This habit is extremely important. It will not only force you to write compact code,but it will help you analytical thinking when it comes to modularize your code. Having big methods with a high degree of indentation (many ifs, for loops etc) is a nightmare. It may seem easy and straightforward when you write a method like that , but after some days even you will have a hard time figuring out when this method even does.

***To add insult to injury, big methods often are not-reusable . They were written to service only on need in project and it will be difficult to be used anywhere else.***

#### 2.Give meaningful names

Both to methods and variables . It is not acceptable for a mid-level developer to have variables named "X" or "xyz" , or even "object" . The purpose of naming variables with English words is so that they have a meaning.

***Communicating with your code is far more important than communicating with documentation and comments.***

***The purpose of comments is to explain the "why" , not the "how" in the code.***
